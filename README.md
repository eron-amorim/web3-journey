# 🚀 My Journey into Web3

Welcome to the public repository documenting my personal and professional transition from traditional engineering to the world of Web3.

I am a **mechatronics engineer** with a strong background in automation, logical systems, and programming (VBA, LabVIEW, C++) — mostly applied in the **medical technology field**, specifically in the maintenance and calibration of specialized ophthalmology equipment.

After more than a decade working in high-precision environments, I made the decision to **rebuild my career from the ground up** and transition into the Web3 space, driven by curiosity, long-term vision, and a desire to contribute to cutting-edge decentralized systems.

## 🧱 Purpose of this Repository

This repository is a living journal of:
- My technical studies in Web3 and blockchain technologies
- Hands-on projects and prototypes (scripts, bots, automation tools)
- Smart contract experiments (using Solidity and Hardhat)
- System design patterns I’m learning in the decentralized ecosystem

Rather than passively consume content, I’m committed to **learning by building** and documenting each step — the successes and the bugs.

## ✅ Projects in Progress

- [x] MetaMask setup, backup phrase security & wallet management  
- [x] Initial interactions with platforms like **Galxe**, **LayerZero**, and **zkSync**  
- [x] API testing with **CoinGecko** for price monitoring  
- [ ] Telegram bot: real-time alerts when ETH gas fees drop below a threshold  
- [ ] Smart contract experiments using **Remix IDE** and basic Solidity functions  
- [ ] Web3 automation playground (bridging, monitoring, transaction triggers)

---

## 🎯 Goals (Next 3–6 Months)

- ✅ Contribute to real-world Web3 open-source projects  
- ✅ Apply for internships and bounties in testing/automation roles  
- ✅ Build and publish a minimal but useful DApp  
- ✅ Join a Web3 hackathon or virtual sprint (ETHGlobal, Encode, etc.)  
- ✅ Launch a resource/tool for other newcomers transitioning into Web3
